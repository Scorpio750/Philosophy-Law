# [Contract Law](id:anchor1)

### Promises

- *Descriptive* (Fried describing the law as it is) or *prescriptive* (Fried saying how the law ought to be)
- **Tort Laws** - laws governing accidental civil complaints regarding injuries to one party
	- *Tort vs. Contract* $$$\to$$$ civil law, not criminal
		- you can sue in a breach of contract/tort, typically for money (true repataions may not be available)
	- $$$\Pi$$$ = plaintiff, $$$\Delta$$$ = defendant
	- So, Tort and Contract have in common:
		- $$$\Pi$$$ was harmed and takes $$$\Delta$$$ to court for money
	- What's the difference?
		- Promise was made $$$\to$$$ realm of *contract*
		- No promise $$$\to$$$ *tort law*

#### Examples

- You order a hamburger, you eat it, walk out without paying
	- You owe the restaurant money; did you make a promise?
		- Implicit promise as transaction?
	- Fried talks about a game $$$\to$$$ Fried has evolved into Wittgenstein
		- Rules are similar to a promise
	- Clearly you have to pay, but it's very unclear on whether this is tort or contract
	- Conventions (Normativity)
		- Do you have to be aware of a convention to be subject to it?	- You go to a machine and buy a coke. You drink it; there's a cigarette butt inside it and you choke
		- Sounds like *tort*
			- Actually sounds more like blarrghh
		- The ingredients, however, do not say anything cig butts; could be viewed as a promise?
		- Say a man on an assembly line did it on purpose
			- Arguably, the man made a promise to Coca Cola to do his job properly, but not to you
			- Your interaction with the vending machine is arguably the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.
