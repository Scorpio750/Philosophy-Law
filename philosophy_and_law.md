# [Contract Law](id:anchor1)

## [Contract as Promise](id:anchor1.1)

- *Descriptive* (Fried describing the law as it is) or *prescriptive* (Fried saying how the law ought to be)
- **Tort Laws** - laws governing accidental civil complaints regarding injuries to one party
	- *Tort vs. Contract* $$$\to$$$ civil law, not criminal
		- you can sue in a breach of contract/tort, typically for money (true repataions may not be available)
	- $$$\Pi$$$ = plaintiff, $$$\Delta$$$ = defendant
	- So, Tort and Contract have in common:
		- $$$\Pi$$$ was harmed and takes $$$\Delta$$$ to court for money
	- What's the difference?
		- Promise was made $$$\to$$$ realm of *contract*
		- No promise $$$\to$$$ *tort law*

### Examples

- You order a hamburger, you eat it, walk out without paying
	- You owe the restaurant money; did you make a promise?
		- Implicit promise as transaction?
	- Fried talks about a game $$$\to$$$ Fried has evolved into Wittgenstein
		- Rules are similar to a promise
	- Clearly you have to pay, but it's very unclear on whether this is tort or contract
	- Conventions (Normativity)
		- Do you have to be aware of a convention to be subject to it?	- You go to a machine and buy a coke. You drink it; there's a cigarette butt inside it and you choke
		- Sounds like *tort*
			- Actually sounds more like blarrghh
		- The ingredients, however, do not say anything cig butts; could be viewed as a promise?
		- Say a man on an assembly line did it on purpose
			- Arguably, the man made a promise to Coca Cola to do his job properly, but not to you
			- Your interaction with the vending machine is arguably the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.
	
### Alternative Views

#### Economists

- Economic Analysis of Law
	- Courts try to reach an efficient outcome
	- What solution maximizes efficiency?
- Exceptions to Fried's View
	- Drugs or Assassinations or other *illegal* contracts.
		- LOL
	- Not every promise need be legally enforced
		- Marriage "I promise to love you forever, somehow"
		- These promises are different and set aside by this theory
	- When do we make promises in the real world?
		- Trivially, every time we say "I promise"

## [Damages and Reparations](id:anchor1.2)

- When a promise made is broken, the promisee receives some equivalent value of what they is promised
- **Expectancy:** value of what was promised
- **Reliance**: where the promisee expends some effort to their detriment because of the promise made by the promissor
- **Executory Agreement:** an agreement wherein there is a transaction agreed upon and the buyer reneges on their promise without any benefit or reliance by either party.
- To determine the value of a commodity, we must determine the **fair market value** of the item, as determined by experts

### Tort vs. Contract


- What if there are damages suffered as a result of a defective product?
	- Is it tort or a breach of contract?
		- Fried says it's a breach of contract, others say tort.
- If there is an injury incurred by a third party, then there is no privity of contract (there was no contract made) between that party and the supplier
- There are also cases of **unjust enrichment**, wherein one party receives a benefit which was intended for another party
	- This is a clear case of *tort*

## Gaps in Contract Law

- False beliefs about facts/material
- Content of Promises
- What happens when things go wrong

### Fairness in Relation to Contract Law

- The domain of fairness lies *outside* of the domain of contract law
	- Lies within the domain of **equities**
- Contract Law deals only with the enforcement of *promises*
	- Can very well be unfair, so long as there was mutual acceptance
- **Bilateral mistakes** - Cases where both parties are mistaken
	- *Sherwood v. Walker* 
		- There is a cow named Rose Abilone III who was sold. 
		- Both parties assumed the cow was barren, in which case it would be worth much less than a fertile cow
		- However, Rose Abilone III turned out to be fertile
		- In a case such as this, Fried says that there was *no agreement made*
		- There was no *meeting of the minds*
		- Although the identity of the chattel purchased is agreed upon, the content of it was not what was expected

- Principles of Fairness:
	1. Faulty Party Loses
	- Buyer Wins
	- Seller Wins
	- Tough Luck
- What makes the last three non-arbitrary?

# [Duty and the Law](id:anchor2)

- **Obligation:** moral duty to do the law because the law requires it.
	- Analogy: command of military superior
	- *Content Independence*

#### Wellman's qualifications:

- Only a *prima facie* obligation to obey the law
- *justness* criterion for satisfiability

### Question of Authority:

- Simmons believes no one has authority
- What grounds authority? Social contract? Respect/morality?
- Simmons is a **philosophical anarchist**

### Taxonomy of Reasons to think there is an Obligation to obey the law

- **Associative:** social roles (citizens)
- **Transactional [Ronald Dworkin]:** Morally significant interactions (promise)
	- This is the most popular theory
- **Natural Duty [Wellman]:** duties inherited in virtue of being a human

### Particularity Objection:

- Free riders

# [Property Law](id:anchor3)

- Relationship of the right (or bundle of rights) one has of possession
	- Distinction between **chattel** (personal) and **land** (real)
- **Wesley Hohfeld** - wrote the most extensive taxonomy on rights

### Rights

- Different kinds of rights
	1. Claim rights
	- Liberties (Williams) / Privileges (Hohfeld)
	- Powers
	- Immunities
- All rights describe actions or omissions
- Only persons have rights
- All rights describe a relation b/w two things
	1. Person
	2. Chattel
- Liberties are the *absence* of a duty *not* to do something
- Williams disagrees with Hohfeld's use of the term **privilege** because it implies something more important than it really is in normal language

### Correlatives

- Person *A's* **claim-rights** are against *B* are *B's* **duties** against *A*
- Your **liberties** end when your **duties** begin
- **No-rights** (not rights) are *correlative* to **liberties**

### Power

- A **power** is the ability to change another person's legal relationships
- Power is correlative to **liability**
- Along the same vein, **immunity** is *correlative* to **disability**

# [Tort Law](id:anchor4)

## Purposes

1. Compensation
2. Deterrence
3. Justice*

### Compensation

- Payment for cost of accident
- Tort is incredibly **selective**
- Frequently *unnecessary* because plaintiffs often have other schemes of compensation (1st-person insurance)
- U.S. has a peculiarly heavy reliance as a means of compensation as compared to other countries
- 38% of all tort cases bear their own costs
- Tort is also viewed as *excessive*
	- *Fraud* and *padding* are rampant in *small* tort cases
	- Much less leeway in large tort cases
- Tort is *regressive*
	- The wealthy receive more compensation than the poor
	$$$$\Delta \to$$$ Independent of Income
	$$$$\Pi \from$$$ Very Dependent on Income
- Tort is also vastly **inefficient**
	- On average, you receive 46Â¢ for every $ you put in

Husak gives Tort a **D-** for compensation

### Deterrence

- Tort is better as a mode of deterrence
- There is an incentive to reduce accident costs
- Tort is good as a deterrent because it is not criminal law, nor regulated by government
	- Tort liability also seems fair
- It limits your **moral hazard**
	- Moral hazard is an empirical phenomenon
	- Avoid actions with high costs
	- [This seems tied in with Expected Utility]

- Insurance reduces the effectiveness of deterrence, esp. when it comes to *property damage*. However, if we eliminate insurance, then we will lose compensation.
- We can distinguish between *tort law* and *criminal law* by saying that criminal law deals with **penal liability**, liabilities that are not covered by insurance.
- In order to maximize deterrance for certain actions, it is best to criminalize them.
- Certain behaviors are undeterrable
	- Unconscious negligable behavior (zoning out when driving)
- **Woebegone Fallacy**
	- Most people think they're better at a certain task than they really are
	- 80% of people think they're better than the average, lol
- Some people have an obsessive attachment to their own behavior
- Bell contends that deterrence drives the cost of unsafe products out of the markets
	- Lead pencils

Husak gives tort a **C** for deterrence

## 11/25/14

**Moral Hazard:** When people shift costs from themselves onto other people

### Economic Analysis of Law

- Cheapest cost avoider 
	- Risk homeostasis
- All about efficiency
- Along that vein, compensation
- Americans have a wedded conviction to the concept of **fault**

## Justice

- Bell and ### see justice as a *goal*
- Husak rather sees justice not as a goal, but rather  a *limitation* for one to achieve their goals
